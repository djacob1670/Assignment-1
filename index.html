		<h3>Brownsville's demographics</h3>
			<p>Brownsville, which has about 1% of New York City's population, has dealt with high rates of food insecurity long before COVID-19. Two issues that have amplified the issue in Brownsville were longstanding poverty issues and a high unemployment, resulting in one-third of residents facing food insecurity, <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/foodscape-brownsville/#:~:text=Food%20Insecurity%3A,32.7%25%20of%20residents%20(2)">according to the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center</a>. Brooklyn Community District 16, which includes Brownsville, Ocean Hill and Broadway Junction, notes that 29.4% of residents have incomes below the NYCgov poverty threshold.

		<h3>Food insecurity is multifaceted</h3>
			<p>
				Nearly 33% of residents in Brownsville face food insecurity, compared to just a little over 15% of all residents in New York City. The Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center highlights how multiple factors exacerbate this issue. The ratio of supermarket to a bodega is one to 15. The median household income in Brownsville is $37,197 compared to $57,782 in New York City. The extreme housing burden for the percentage of renters in Brownsville is 37.7% compared to New York City's 28%. Combined, these factors and others create an environment that amplifies food security.

		<h3>COVID-19 has made things worse</h3>
			<p>
				COVID-19 uprooted lives physically, mentally, financially and beyond all across the country. But the hardships that have been suffered are not equal. A New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/05/upshot/us-unemployment-maps-coronavirus.html">analysis</a> found that in June, "most neighborhoods in the Bronx had unemployment rates of 20 percent, while most neighborhoods south of 95th Street in Manhattan had rates less than half that." The New York Times notes that the author's of the analysis, Yair Ghitza and Mark Steitz, "estimated unemployment at the census tract level based on national economic statistics over the last six months. <a href="https://deepmaps.io/maps/">Their projection</a> for unemployment in Brownsville found that the unemployment rate in certain parts of Brownsville is as high as 42%.

		<h3>Community organizations serving as a lifeline</h3>
			<p>
				Residents of Brownsville have a number of organizations at their disposal that can help them if they're facing food insecurity. According to the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, there are two community gardens, 21 GreenThumb community gardens, two school gardens, nine farmers' markets, two WIC sites and 18 pantry and soup kitchens. Even though demand is greater than ever, some organizations are managing to keep up. Before the pandemic, the Salvation Army Brooklyn Brownsville Corps Community Center helped around 1,000 people a month, according to Charlene Williams-Mahon, the organization's social ministries coordinator. She says that number is now closer to 3,000. The Phoenix Commmunity Garden in nearby Ocean Hill is one of the 21 community gardens in the area. Mark Leger, 63, a member of the garden's steering commmittee, said distribution has increased from 32 to 96 people since the pandemic began.
